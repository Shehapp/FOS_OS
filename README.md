# Memory and CPU Management Documentation

## Virtual Memory

Virtual memory is a crucial aspect of system management, utilizing both RAM and Disk resources to enhance the performance and efficiency of a computer system.

## Parallel Program Execution

Efficiently load and run multiple programs in parallel to make the most out of system resources and ensure optimal multitasking capabilities.

## Page Fault Handler

### Replacement Strategies

Implementing strategies for handling page faults, including replacement algorithms:

- FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)

## Dynamic Allocation and Deallocation

Facilitate dynamic memory management with features such as dynamic allocation and deallocation. For example, creating new threads dynamically using constructs like `new Thread()`.

## Environment Cleanup

Ensure proper cleanup and resource release when programs or threads exit. This includes releasing allocated memory and other resources to maintain system integrity.

## How to Use

Provide instructions or code snippets on how to incorporate and utilize the memory and CPU management features in your project.

### Example:

```java
// Code snippet for dynamic allocation and thread creation
Thread newThread = new Thread();
// ... (additional code)

// Code snippet for releasing resources on program exit
// ...
